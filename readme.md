### Core Features

#### 1. NFT Synthesis System
Our unique synthesis system allows users to combine NFTs to create more valuable assets:

**Basic Synthesis**
- Stake two different NFTs to mint a rarer Compound NFT
- Each combination results in unique properties based on the original NFTs
- Synthesized NFTs often carry higher market value than individual components

**Advanced Synthesis (V2)**
- Take your Compound NFT to the next level
- Stake your Compound NFT with another eligible NFT
- Create an even rarer Compound NFT V2 with enhanced properties
- Build complex NFT combinations through multiple synthesis levels

#### 2. Flexible Staking Rewards
We offer multiple paths to earn rewards from your NFTs:

- Minimum staking period: 7 days
- Return your Compound NFT to the vault after the staking period
- Receive back your original NFTs
- Earn $CPG (Compound GO) tokens as staking rewards

**Reward Calculation**
- Rewards are dynamically calculated based on:
  - Staking duration
  - Circulation metrics of staked NFTs

#### 3. NFT Burn Mechanism
Strategic burning mechanism for NFT value management:

**Requirements**
1. Circulation Threshold:
   - Current NFT circulation must be below 2/3 of the collection's total supply
   - This requirement ensures sustainable tokenomics
   
2. Time Lock:
   - NFT must be at least 30 days old from its initial issuance
   - Prevents market manipulation and ensures system stability

**Benefits**
- Receive $CPG tokens as compensation
- Help maintain healthy NFT circulation
- Contribute to the ecosystem's long-term sustainability
