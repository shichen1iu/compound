## Project Introduction:
Compound: This is a protocol focused on NFT staking and trading. We have multiple Compound pools.

### Compound
Through Compound, you can convert two staked NFTs into a rarer Compound NFT.
Like this:

Furthermore, Compound NFTs can continue to be staked with another NFT you hold to obtain a Compound NFT V2.

### Staking Rewards
Compound NFTs obtained by staking two NFTs can be traded. However, if you don't want to trade your Compound NFT and only want to receive staking rewards, you can return the Compound NFT to the vault after a certain period (>7 days). The vault will then return your two staked NFTs and provide staking reward tokens $CPG (Compound GO). The amount of staking rewards ($CPG) is related to the staking duration and the circulation of the two staked NFTs.

### Burn
If one day you no longer want your NFT, you can choose to burn it, which will reward you with a certain amount of $CPG.
However, there are two requirements for this:
1. The current NFT circulation < 2/3 of the total circulation of that NFT collection (due to users performing compound operations, reducing the NFT circulation)
2. The NFT must have been issued for > 30 days
This operation can only be performed when both requirements are met simultaneously.
